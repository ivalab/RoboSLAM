Our research is geared towards mid-level control of
biologically-inspired robotic systems.  We consider low-level control to
live at the level of the gait, and the design of gaits that preserve
locomotion stability of the robot itself.  This is a pretty big research
problem for legged locomotion, since legged robots can fall. However,
for other biologically-inspired robots, stability is a bit easier to
achieve when moving over planar ground. We focus on this class of
robotic systems, with the aim of using known gaits to derive controlled
equations of motion that are analytically tractable.  This means that it
is possible to do one of two things: 
(1) make steps towards proving that a control policy will work or 
(2) transform the controlled gait equations into control equations that
make the robotic animal look like a traditional robot (like a Roomba or
an automobile). Once its mathematically looks like a traditional robot,
we can use all of the nice machinery associated to typical robots for
achieving autonomous operation.

So far, we have been studying snake locomotion with the intent to figure
out how to perform planning, trajectory synthesis, and feedback control
for this class of bio-inspired robots.  We got the theory mostly worked
out for flat planar surface, and hope that we can experimentally verify
the mathematics.  So far, we've got rectilinear motion down, and are going
to take care of sidewinding next.  Lateral undulation is a bit trickier
since the motion dynamics are a bit more complex.
