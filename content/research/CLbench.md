**Abstract:** SLAM has long been envisioned as a means to assist
robots performing navigation tasks in unknown environments.  Yet,
benchmarking for SLAM most often uses open-loop data sets due for
reproducibility. Given that open-loop and closed-loop task performance
measures may not align, establishing a means to use SLAM in the
closed-loop for benchmarking is an important next step in algorithm
development. A ROS/Gazebo environment for SLAM benchmarking has been
created and open sourced. Several stereo visual-inertial implementations
are tested and compared. The Good Feature SLAM approach provides
competitive and robust closed-loop trajectory tracking in unknown
environments and without external absolute position measurements.
