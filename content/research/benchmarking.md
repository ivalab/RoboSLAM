**Abstract:** Systematic study of SLAM might benefit from a _design of
experiments_ type of benchmarking approach, as well as means to gauge
_best possible_ performance versus nominal performance. One way to
better understand SLAM systems is if a good set of benchmarks could be
established for quickly gauging general performance. Using decision
trees dominant SLAM benchmark and SLAM performance factors can be easily
determined. They can then inform algorithm development.
On the _best possible_ performance, we advocate for the use of _slo-mo_
processing, which provides practically no per-frame time constraint on
the SLAM solver. The _slo-mo_ results should be upper bounds on SLAM
performance compared to the same method run with real-time constraints.
