**Abstract:** Our _good features_ investigation has mostly addressed the
front-end component. This inquiry studies the back-end, local map optimization
process of ORB-SLAM to actively manage its computational properties.
_Good graph_ describes a process for determining how large of a local map
to use and how to select the camera poses from the larger global map.
It improves the run-time properties of the back-end optimization while
supporting improved localization for the front-end.
